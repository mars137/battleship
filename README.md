# battleship

Simplified version of battleship, a board is simply a grid of potentially attacked positions along
with one or more ships each of which occupy one or more positions. Your task is to model a board
and implement the attack function for a board and position. 

Managing multiple players, reading
user input, or actually playing a game is beyond the scope of the exercise, which is focused
only on the state and logic required to execute a single attack.
